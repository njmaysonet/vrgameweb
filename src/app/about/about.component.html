            <p>
                The UCF Cultural VR Project's goal is to design a virtual reality video game
                that teaches players about different cultures and also asks them to go through
                possible real life scenarios concerning acceptable behaviors and norms present
                in that culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such we have decided to create a web platform from which users can find out
                more information about the game and look up their user profiles to look over their
                progress. This is supported by a database that collects information about how users
                acted in their play sessions to allow study of how users made their choices and what
                they learned.
            </p>
            <p>
                We utilize the Unity&copy;, HTC Vive&copy; and SteamVR&copy; technologies for game development
                as well as NodeJS, Express, Angular, and MySQL to run the website front-end and back-end.

                    <h3> Personal Statement </h3>
                    <p class="team-card-p"> “My personal motivation in doing this project is two-fold. 
                        The first is that I’m a big fan of animation and would like
                         to get into the animated film industry one day, and I feel 
                         that doing this VR VIVE game via Unity is a good way to get 
                         experience with many aspects of that industry such as modeling, 
                         design, storyboarding, etc. The second reason is that I feel 
                         this is one of the more helpful and useful projects to do, 
                         especially in this day and age. Living in a world where fear 
                         of others who are different than you (especially culturally 
                         different) is rampant, I feel that a project such as this 
                         that teaches about dealing with people of different cultures 
                         is nigh an obligation to be completed! Not only will this 
                         project help Americans learn about other cultures,
                          but other cultures will learn about America. 
                          Education kills ignorance and I’m doing my part by being
                           part of this project!”

                    <p class="team-card-p"> “I’m especially interested in working with state-of-the-art technologies like virtual reality and being able to create something that will help encourage travel and the spread of cultures around the world. Throughout this project I’m excited to learn about the Vive and Unity engine as I see them becoming a standard in the future of entertainment, or in Unity’s case, what’s already the standard for video game and app development. My hope is that this app will make others more comfortable about traveling to other places, whether it be on business, vacation, or any reason, especially in being able to find help if they need to and knowing what to do if they, say, need to buy groceries or take a bus. In doing so, we can come further together as a human race and enjoy what makes each other great.”

                        Leveraging the Vive API with Unity is an extremely valuable experience with a relatively new technology within the gaming industry. Coupled with the task of representing different aspects of different cultures, I hope to be able to provide an immersive experience to our users so that they have a feeling of being transported to a foreign place. The project’s scope is interesting, and the needs of our sponsor dictate that we produce a flexible, easy-to-use, and easy-to-modify system for adding on to base we produce in the future. In planning and implementing such a system, I believe all our group members will learn a great deal of knowledge that will be a great boon to us as we continue on to our careers wherever they may lead us.”

                    “Ever since I was a kid I wanted to make video games for a living, and I’ve been trying ever since the sixth grade. For me, this isn’t a simple project, but a great chance to gain experience with virtual reality technology, and a great piece to showcase in my portfolio. Unity3D is a program that I am very familiar with, and the community that comes with it I’ve learned to love. As someone who has actually travelled to a few countries in Asia, as well as made friends from various foreign countries, I think that people should have the opportunity to meet people from around the world. Meeting people from different countries and perspectives helps you appreciate those cultures, as well as give a sense of personal identity and appreciation of one’s own culture. Many people would be grateful for the chance to practice one’s social skills in a foreign country in a virtual environment. Had I the opportunity to use this web application before embarrassing myself in front of an Italian girl, I certainly would have appreciated it.”

                    Dr. Emily K. Johnson, a postdoctoral research associate coordinating the Games Research Lab, is a recent graduate of the Texts & Technology Ph.D. program at UCF. Her dissertation, “Making Waves, Mixing Colors, and Using Mirrors: The Self-regulated Learning Support Features and Procedural Rhetoric of Three Whole-Body Educational Games” incorporates research from several fields including game studies, literacy studies, education, embodied learning, and psychology to examine the ways that these types of games teach science content, scaffold self-regulated learning skills, and reinforce specific playing techniques and cultural and pedagogical values. Emily is a former middle school teacher who is passionate about research, technology, learning, and fun. Her research interests include: Educational Technology, Simulations and Learning, Self-Regulated Learning, Gameful Learning, Learning and Motivation, In Situ/Stealth Assessments, Self-Efficacy and Learning, and Oral History.
